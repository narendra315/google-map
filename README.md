Google Markers are added on the google map dynamically and then made to follow a given set of co-ordinates which can be replaced by an API call. While moving from one co-ordinate to another they draw a polyline on the co-ordinates they have covered. Once they reach the end polyline is cleared and again start from the starting point.
