# google-map
index.html 
Dummy markers are added on the google map dynamically and then made to follow a set of co-ordinates. While moving from one co-ordinate to another they draw a trail/polyline on the co-ordinates they have covered. Once they reach the end trail/polyline is cleared and start from the starting point.
